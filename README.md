Scope and Objective of Project:-
![ABOUT](https://github.com/Ronewa112/Library-Assistant-in-Java/assets/110073721/891f58f2-4748-49ec-a9dc-c442d6b487b2)

  - The Library Management System allows the Librarian to login using a username and a password to access the system. 

  - The Librarian can perform many functions after logging into the system, such as, adding a new book, adding a new student, issuing a book, returning (accepting) a book, and view transactions (statistics about issuing and returning of books).

  - In the System, every book has an ISBN no., Name, Author, and a Price. 

  - Every student has a student ID, Name, Course, Branch, and Year.

  - While issuing a book the Librarian must enter the ISBN number of the book, the ID of the student, and the issue date. 

  - When the book is returned, student ID is entered by the Librarian to get details of the book issued, further the return date is mentioned and the bookâ€™s status is changed to returned/available.


MYSQL has been used for database in this project. It contains 4 tables :- 

 - Book : This table contains fields like ISBN, Title, Author, Quantity and Price.
    
  -	Admin: This table contains fields like User_id and Password.
    
  -	Student: This table contains fields like Student_ID, Name, Course, Branch and Year. 
  
  -	Record: This table contains fields like Return_Date, ISBN, Student_id and Issue_Date.

MYSQL setup :- 
 
Create all the tables beforehand

Creating Database

    CREATE DATABASE library_management_system;

    USE library_management_system;

Create Book Table

    CREATE TABLE Book(ISBN int primary key, Title varchar(20) not null, Author varchar(20) not null, Price int default 0, Quantity int default 0,CHECK (Price>=0),CHECK (Quantity>=0));

Create Student Table

    CREATE TABLE Student(SID int primary key, Name varchar(20) not null, Course varchar(20) not null, Branch varchar(20) not null, Email varchar(30) not null );

Create Issue_Book Table

    CREATE TABLE Issue_Book (ISBN int, SID int,IssueDate date not null, foreign key Fk1(ISBN) references Book(ISBN),foreign key Fk2(SID) references Student(SID) ); 

Create Return_Book Table

    CREATE TABLE Return_Book (SID int,ISBN int, ReturnDate date not null, foreign key Fk1(SID) references Student(SID),foreign key Fk2(ISBN) references Book(ISBN) );

Record Table

    CREATE TABLE Record (SID int, ISBN int, IssueDate date default null, ReturnDate date default null,foreign key Fk1(SID) references Student(SID), foreign key Fk2(ISBN) references Book(ISBN) ); 

One all this tables have been created, clone the project, open in netbeans, run the project.
